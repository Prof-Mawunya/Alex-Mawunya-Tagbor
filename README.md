## About Me
<!-- This is HTML embedded inside Markdown for enhanced formatting -->
<div style="line-height: 1.7;">
  Hello! I'm <strong>Alex Mawunya Tagbor</strong>, a committed learner in the <strong>ALX Front-End Developer</strong> program and an aspiring software engineer who believes that <em>technology has the power to transform learning, opportunity, and lives</em>.
  <br/><br/>
  My journey into tech began with a simple yet powerful motivation: <strong>to solve problems and create digital tools that empower people</strong>. I‚Äôm particularly passionate about building:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Innovative educational web applications</strong></li>
    <li>Self-directed learning platforms for all learning styles</li>
    <li>Tools that bridge gaps in offline and low-tech communities</li>
  </ul>

## What I'm Working On

### **My Tech Services Website** ‚Äì [View Project](https://emmedia.netlify.app/)

I‚Äôm currently building a business website that connects individuals and businesses to **skilled service providers** in:

- üíª Web Development
- üé® Graphic Design
- üõ†Ô∏è PC Maintenance & Tech Support
- üñ®Ô∏è Digital Printing & Tech Services

Unlike traditional agencies, this platform allows users to **find and contact independent service providers** based on their needs ‚Äî kind of like a local freelancer directory. The site does not currently provide the services itself, but helps people access trusted tech professionals in one place.  
 *(I'm working on features that will allow the platform to eventually offer services directly too.)*
